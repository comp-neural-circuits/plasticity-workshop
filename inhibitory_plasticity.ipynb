    "Welcome to the bonus section on the **inhibitory plasticity**! Here, we will consider one postsynaptic neuron which receives $N$ presynaptic inputs (both excitatory and inhibitory). We start by visualizing how the inhibitory plasticity shapes the connections between the inhibitory presynaptic neurons and the postsynaptic neuron. Then, we will deepen the analysis by comparing the dynamics in the two cases of no plasticity and inhibitory plasticity.\n",

    "The general framework of the following is taken from [Vogels et al, 2011](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.1211095): the model used for the postsynaptic neuron is a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron, characterized by a time constant, $ \\tau= 20$ ms, and a resting membrane potential, $V_{rest} = -60$ mV. Whenever the membrane potential crosses a spiking threshold of $V_\\theta = −50 $mV, an action potential is generated and the membrane potential is reset to the resting potential, where it remains clamped for a $\\tau_{ref}= 5$ ms refractory period (i.e. the neuron cannot spike over this period).  The subthreshold membrane voltage $V_i(t)$ obeys:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V_I = -80$ mV is the reversal inhibitory potential, $g_i^E$ and $g_i^I$ are the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductance respectively, and $g^{leak}$ is a constant, leak conductance.\n",
    "When the neuron receives a presynaptic action potential, the postsynaptic conductance is increased\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g_i^E \\rightarrow g_i^E + \\bar g_E W_i \\text{ for an excitatory spike and } \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g_i^I \\rightarrow g_i^I + \\bar g_I W_i \\text{ for an inhibitory spike} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar g $ is a constant and $W_i$ is the synaptic weight from neuron $i$ to the postsynaptic neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, these parameters obey the equations\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tau_E \\frac{dg_i^E}{dt} = -g_i^E\\text{  and  } \\tau_I \\frac{dg_i^I}{dt} = -g_i^I\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with synaptic time constants $\\tau_E = 5$ ms and $\\tau_I = 10$ ms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement the temporal evolution of the postsynaptic firing rate, and the total excitatory, inhibitory, and net membrane currents, first in the absence of plasticity and then with inhibitory synaptic plasticity. In the latter case, we will keep track of each spike and we will update the inhibitory synaptic weights, following the same procedure described above in section **2.1.**\n",

# Workshop on Synaptic Plasticity

Authors : *Claudia Cusseddu, Shreya Lakhera, Dylan Festa*

Welcome to the workshop on synaptic plasticity !

This is a brand new tutorial, so expect to find typos, bugs and some rough edges. Please help us improve it by sharing your feedback with us!

Solutions to exercise will be provided by the TAs (this is supposed to be a *very interactive* session, so please do not be shy!). Alternatively (not reccomended) you can dig in the dev branch of our [github repository](https://github.com/comp-neural-circuits/plasticity-workshop/tree/dev).

Please open the exercise notebooks using the links below, and **save a copy in your Google drive** (otherwise you might lose your progress)

If you have any issue, please send a direct message to one of the TAs, over the zoom session. If you have zoom issues you can email `dylan.festa`  at `brain.mpg.de`
